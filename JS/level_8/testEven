I wrote this function to check true/false for an odd/even number do to the given constraints: 
Determine if the number passed is even (or not).
The function needs to return either a true or false.
Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.
Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata. -->
testEven = (n) => {
  return n % 2 === 0
}
